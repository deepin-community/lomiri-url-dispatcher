Introduction

This is a small handler to take URLs and do what is appropriate with them.
That could be anything from launching a web browser to just starting an
application.  This is done over DBus because application confinement doesn't
allow for doing it from a confined application otherwise.  It's important
the that applications can't know about each other, so this is a fire and forget
type operation.
